The purpose of the data collection and generation is to assess the state of the art of Social Science and Humanities journals' citation data coverage in OpenCitation databases and investigate how many of these are Open Access. The data will be used to analyze which countries and disciplines hold the most publications and journals. This information is essential to achieving the project's objectives of understanding the openness of Social Science and Humanities publications and promoting cross-disciplinary collaboration and wider dissemination of knowledge.</div><div><br></div>",
